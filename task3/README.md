# AIDD-30-days-challenge - Task 3

## 📂 Part A — Research Questions (Short Answers)

### **1️⃣ What new improvements were introduced in Gemini 3.0?**  
Gemini 3.0 delivers major upgrades in intelligence, reasoning, and coding performance.  
It surpasses previous versions like Gemini 2.5 Pro across all major AI benchmarks and performs stronger in agentic workflows, long-context tasks, and zero-shot problem solving.  
It also improves multimodal accuracy, supports advanced developer tools, and integrates seamlessly into production coding environments such as Gemini CLI, Android Studio, Google Antigravity, and modern IDEs.

### **2️⃣ How does Gemini 3.0 improve coding & automation workflows?**  
Gemini 3.0 greatly improves coding and automation by introducing stronger agentic coding abilities, better long-context reasoning, and deeper tool use. It can operate terminals, manage multi-file refactors, debug complex projects, and handle long-horizon tasks across entire codebases. With integrations like Google Antigravity, Gemini CLI, Android Studio, and modern IDEs, it automates development steps, executes complex workflows, and turns high-level prompts into complete apps — making the entire coding process faster, smarter, and more autonomous.

### **3️⃣ How does Gemini 3.0 improve multimodal understanding?**  
The docs says that gemini 3 is the best model in the world for complex multimodal tasking, it has set new highs on MMMU-pro for image reasoning and video MMMU for video reasoning.They have increased the understanding of i.Visual reasoning , ii.Spatial reasoning, iii.Video reasoning for the improvement of multimodal understanding. 

### **4️⃣ Name any two developer tools introduced with Gemini 3.0.**  
✔ **Google Antigravity** — New agentic development platform
✔ **Android Studio** —  It is the official IDE for android development, and includes everything you need to build Android apps.
✔ **Gemini CLI 3.0** — Advanced command-line tool for coding & automation
