# Research: Menu-Driven Basic Calculator

**Date**: 2025-12-02

## Summary

Given the detailed user-provided plan flow and the simplicity of a basic CLI calculator, no extensive research was required. The core technical choices (Python, CLI, standard library) are aligned with the project constitution and prior agreements.

## Findings

- No outstanding "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" items from the `plan.md` were identified.
- No external dependencies require research as the project is constrained to the Python Standard Library.
- Standard arithmetic operations are well-defined and do not require specific algorithmic research.
